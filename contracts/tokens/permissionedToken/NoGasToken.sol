/**
* @title NoGasToken
* @notice Extends the permissioned token by providing functionality for users to interact with
* the permissioned token contract without needing to pay gas fees. NoGasToken will perform the 
* exact same actions as a normal PermissionedToken, but first it will validate a signature of the 
* hash of the parameters and ecrecover() a signature to prove the signer so everything is still 
* cryptographically backed. Then, instead of doing actions on behalf of msg.sender, 
* it will move the signerâ€™s tokens. Finally, we can also wrap in a token reward to incentivise the relayer.
* @notice inspiration from @austingriffith and @PhABCD for leading the meta-transaction innovations
